## Open Source Intelligence (Easy)

For this challenge, we are told to search pasetbin for a particular string "W1wg70w4zOv2vxPZ". A quick google search reveals a few pastebin links including [this one](https://pastebin.com/Z1qbAeiT).

The text from the pastbin link is as follows:

```
The results of the scan show that the entire 10 255 1 0 subnet is vulnerable. We have identified that .22 is the domain controller and should be the primary focus. The DNS server is on .53, not the most original IT person!! 

Zone transfers are not secured and can be done to an external address! I suggest we continue recon for another 42 days to ensure we have everything we can get. On the 43rd day we will strike! 

One final thing. The CEOs Twitter account has photos of her dog. This might become relevant if we need to reset her accounts. 

W1wg70w4zOv2vxPZ
```
This reveals that the correct answer is **42** (along with the answer to life, the universe, and everything)
